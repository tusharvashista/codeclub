              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p> Welcome to Technocamps Code Club!

                We are an organization based at the Cardiff University Computer Science Department Outreach Office in the UK. Our mission is to provide students with the opportunity to learn and develop their skills in various areas of computer science, including programming, web development, game development, and more.<br><br>
                
                Our Code Club runs on Fridays from 4pm to 6pm after school, and is held entirely online. We believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or circumstances. That's why we've designed our Code Club to be accessible to students from all over the world.<br><br>
                
                Our dedicated team of experienced instructors is committed to providing a fun and engaging learning experience for our students. We believe that learning should be enjoyable and interactive, and we strive to make our lessons as hands-on as possible.<br><br>
                
                If you are interested in joining our Code Club, simply send us an email at <b>cardiff@technocamps.com</b> expressing your interest. We will be happy to provide you with more information about the club and help you get started.<br><br>
                
                Thank you for considering Technocamps Code Club. We look forward to helping you develop your skills in computer science!<br><br>
